These include, among other things, statements regarding:\n\n- the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;\n- fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;\n- our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;\n- our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase and may affect our margins;\n- our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which could affect our overall margins;\n- our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;\n- fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;\n- monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;\n- our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for our performance in international markets as users in developing economies increasingly come online;\n- our expectation that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;\n- the amount and timing of revenue recognition from customer contracts with commitments for performance revenue;\n- our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including the expected increase in our technical infrastructure investment to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services;\n- our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;\n- our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;\n- our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;\n- estimates of our future compensation expenses;\n- our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OIE), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely driven by market dynamics;\n- our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;\n- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;\n- the sufficiency of our sources of funding;\n- contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results;\n- our potential exposure in connection with new and pending investigations, proceedings, and other conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;\n- that we will continue to face heightened regulatory scrutiny and changes in regulatory conditions.\n---\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n---\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Alphabet Inc:\n\nused by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across 133 languages in Google Translate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures. This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language understanding: Google Search understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\n\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\n\nFor example, in 2020, Google DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, we have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold's protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-eating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information, analysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action: Using advanced AI and geospatial flooding information to communities and individuals.\n\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly; we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful: With a bold and responsible approach we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\n\n# Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\n\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and rigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we launched Gemini; our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published these in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety; and avoidance of harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible; we believe it is possible and in fact critical to embrace that tension productively.\n\n# Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\n\nAI is not only a powerful enabler; it is also a major platform shift. Globally; businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation: That is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Google's latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our own products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment; and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document; and operate software.\n\n# Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\n\nThings that we now consider routine like spell check; mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Maps all use AI: As AI continues to improve rapidly; we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful: to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace helps users write, visualize, organize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings: Bard allows users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration.\n\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\n---\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Alphabet Inc:\n\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses and we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and all of Google's properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, creating uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products for free. Additionally, we are experimenting with conversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\n\n# Build the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\n\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Best Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome operating systems with new AI-forward user experiences.\n\n# Moonshots\n\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\n\n# Privacy and Security\n\nWe do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We are strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design, and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\n\n# Google\n\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud:\n\n# Google Services\n\n# Serving Our Users\n\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized worldwide.\n\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for.\n\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music.\n---\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Alphabet Inc:\n\nreading books and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content: invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser; and Chrome operating system, as well as growing our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices such as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on everyday is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\n\n# How We Make Money\n\nmarketing businesses. We have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\n\n# Google Services\n\ngenerates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties. We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n# Performance Advertising\n\ncreates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\n# Brand Advertising\n\nhelps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\n# Additional Revenue Streams\n\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising; including consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; and devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\n\n# Google Cloud\n\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other cloud services. Through our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues.\n\n# Key Capabilities from Google Cloud\n\n- AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models.\n- Cybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with AI integrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n- Databases and Analytics: provides to store and manage data for different types of applications. Our Data Cloud also unifies a variety of different types of databases including relational, key-value, in-memory data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud.\n---\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Alphabet Inc:\n\n# Collaboration Tools:\n\nGoogle Workspace and Duet Al in Google Workspace provide easy-to-use, secure communication and collaboration tools, including apps like Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Meet; and more. These tools enable secure hybrid and remote work, boosting productivity and collaboration. Al has been used in Google Workspace for years to improve grammar; efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply; Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Duet Al in Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\n# Al Platform and Duet Al for Google Cloud:\n\nOur Vertex Al platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment; and deploy applications using generative Al models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet Al for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged Al agents that assist developers to write, test, document;, and operate software.\n\n# Other Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet; we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change: Alphabets investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the RED phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors.\n\nWhile these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries: Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\n\n# Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n\n- general purpose search engines and information services;\n- vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n- online advertising platforms and networks;\n- other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n- digital content and application platform providers;\n- providers of enterprise cloud services;\n- developers and providers of Al products and services;\n- companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;\n- providers of digital video services;\n- social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;\n- providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n- digital assistant providers.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses: For example; for advertising, competing successfully depends largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security; and availability of our products and services; on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n---\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Alphabet Inc:\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n# Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability\n\nOur core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google's founding more than 25 years ago. We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet: Sustainability is one of our sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners and customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\n\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\n\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by 2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\n\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy: Since 2017, we have matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind and because of the variable supply of these resources, we still need to rely on carbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\n\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear: Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\n\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater volume we consume on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate.\n\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our circularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\n\nGoogle's Environmental Report: The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n# Culture and Workforce\n\nWe encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society: We are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and our people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development; resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles and rewarding them well.\n\nWe provide a variety of high-quality training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities—ranging from courses for new managers to coaching and individual support. At Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google's approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.","job_metadata":{"credits_used":49.0,"job_credits_usage":0,"job_pages":0,"job_is_cache_hit":true,"credits_max":1000}}
